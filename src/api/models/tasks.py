                Helpful Tips:
                - To find the blog articles names and URLs, perform searches on Google such like the following:
                    - "{company} [POSITION HERE] blog articles"
                - To find the youtube interviews, perform searches on YouTube such as the following:
                    - "{company} [POSITION HERE] interview"

                Important:
                - Once you've found the information, immediately stop searching for additional information.
                - Only return the requested information. NOTHING ELSE!
                - Do not generate fake information. Only return the information you find. Nothing else!
                - Do not stop researching until you find the requested information for each position in the company.
